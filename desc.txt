tabula-rasa

An online single-page tool written in JQuery and Golang for managing a relational database. The user can read, create, update and delete (databases?,) tables and data through a front-end interface. Later it will be used for storing data that has been scraped by a web crawler that will probably be written in Python. The data will be used to build Machine Learning models...


Hi, 
I've started getting into Golang a few months ago, and I liked so much that now I want to transition from Java to Golang . I find it really enjoyable to work in. For a few months I have worked for a client in Golang, mainly automatizing deployment of VMs to OpenStack using GopherCloud. Now, I'm developing an API in Golang for my own needs, but also to continue learning it (https://github.com/zale144/tabula-rasa/). 
So I think I would be able to contribute to your startup :)

All the best,

Aleksandar
