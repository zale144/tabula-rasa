# tabula-rasa
TabulaRasa is a demo web app written in Golang and React.js for managing a relational database.
The user can read, create, update and delete tables and data through a front-end interface.
Later on it could be used for storing data that has been scraped by a web crawler that will probably be written in Python.
One idea is to use this data to build Machine Learning models...
